# Sine-Function-Plotter

This is a quick project whipped up in an evening by request of my physics teacher (originally completed on 31/03/2021).
It's nothing much, but it's here. 

### Controls

 - Left/right click: phase shift (discreet intervals)
 - Left/right arrow: phase shift (continuous movement, sped up by by holding L_SHIFT)
 - "V" key: visual cue
